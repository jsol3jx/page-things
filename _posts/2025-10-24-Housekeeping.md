This is a work in progress for me. I have mainly updated my About page for now. I plan to start posting some blogs about some of the things I've had to figure out over the last
few years. Mainly some of the things I had to engineer at my old role. This may take a bit since this is my first time using Github Pages but so far it's been pretty easy. So bear with me as I get more comfortable with this.
