<h2>My Resume</h2>

<p> Hey, I’m John, a DevOps Engineer who loves building and automating things in the cloud. Over the years I’ve worked across AWS, Terraform, Docker, and a bunch of other tools that help turn infrastructure chaos into something reliable and easy to manage.</p>
<p>I like figuring out how to make systems run smoother and faster, whether that’s automating AMI builds with Packer, spinning up CI/CD pipelines in Harness or Jenkins, or cutting cloud costs by rethinking how resources are used. I’ve spent a lot of time working with ECS, Elastic Beanstalk, and containerized environments, and I get a lot of satisfaction out of taking something manual and turning it into a clean, repeatable process.</p>
<p>Before diving deep into DevOps, I worked in Azure and VMware environments managing virtualization and networking for large global systems. That background gave me a solid understanding of how everything fits together, from the hardware to the cloud layer.</p>
<p>These days I’m big on using tools like ChatGPT and Cursor to help with code reviews and troubleshooting. I’m always learning new ways to automate and simplify things because at the end of the day, I just like building stuff that works well and makes life easier for the team. </p>
